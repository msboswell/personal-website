# Personal Website

Source code repo for my personal website, hosted at
[milesboswell.com](https://milesboswell.com).

> Currently, this code is not deployed to the production website, so if you go
> there, don't be surprised.

## TODO

- [x] Recreate homepage with background image
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Add content to footer
- [x] On Github Push, automatically re-build and redeploy on production server
- [ ] Add other site content (like what is displayed in
      [/html](https://milesboswell.com/html))
- [ ] Add blog to `/blog` route
- could be made directly in React
- could try to make it in Gatsby (make sure routing still works)
- running WordPress in a Docker container is cool and easy
- there are other ways of making an easily managable blog

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
