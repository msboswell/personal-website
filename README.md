# Personal Website

Source code repo for my personal website, hosted at
[milesboswell.com](https://milesboswell.com).

## TODO

- [x] Recreate homepage with background image
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Add content to footer
- [ ] Optimize UI for mobile screens
- [x] On Github Push, automatically re-build and redeploy on production server
- [ ] Add other site content (like what is displayed in
      [/html](https://milesboswell.com/html))
- [ ] Add blog to `/blog` route

  - could be made directly in React
  - could try to make it in Gatsby (make sure routing still works)
  - running WordPress in a Docker container is cool and easy
  - there are other ways of making an easily managable blog

At some point, maybe the whole site could be migrated to Gatsby. Currently, this
sounds like a good idea because the whole site seems pretty static anyways.
Gatsby could also improve image loading, like the huge background image on the
home page.

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
